# Linear_Regression_Modeling

This is a two-part project for my data science class. The dataset consists of over 500,000 housing sale records from Cook County, Illinois, the county where Chicago is located. In the project, I built a multiple linear regression model predicting house prices in from various housing features, e.g. number of bedrooms, stories. I encoded some features using One Hot Encoding; performed feature engineering and passed them into my model. My model achieved an RMSE around 190K for testing data, which was small for the dataset and earned a full score in the project.
